## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Set these in `.env.local` (not committed):

| Variable               | Description                                        | Example                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -----------------------         |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Base URL for REST API calls and refresh-token flow | `http://localhost:4000/api/vi`  |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`  | Base URL used by Socket.IO client                  | `http://localhost:4000`         |

Referenced in:

- `lib/api.js` uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` for `${BASE_URL}/auth/refresh-token`
- `lib/socket.js` uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to initialize Socket.IO

Example `.env.local`:

NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000


## üß™ Installation & Running

### Option 1: Local Development

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create `.env.local` as shown above

3. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`.

### Option 2: Production Build

1. Build the app

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the production server

```bash
npm run start
```

Ensure the same environment variables are configured on your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel project settings).


## üí° Usage Notes

- The frontend expects HTTP-only auth cookies set by the backend. All fetches include credentials via `credentials: "include"`.
- On a 401 response, the client calls `${NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/auth/refresh-token` to renew the session.
- Socket connections use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and also include credentials. Ensure CORS allows them.

## üßØ Troubleshooting

- **401 loops**: Confirm backend `/auth/refresh-token` exists, is reachable, and sets cookies for the correct domain.
- **Socket connection fails**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is correct and Socket.IO CORS allows credentials.
- **Styles not applying**: Ensure Tailwind v4 is installed, and classes are present in `app/**/*.jsx/js` files.

## üîê Security Considerations (Frontend)

- Uses cookie-based auth; tokens should be HTTP-only and managed by the backend.
- All requests use `credentials: include` to avoid leaking cookies to wrong origins.
- Avoid logging sensitive data in the browser console.
